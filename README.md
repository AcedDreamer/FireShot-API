# FireShot-API
By using this API, you can make web page screenshots of your web site.

For example, this can be a button or just an event that launches FireShot and opens the editor with the captured web page. You can think of the other ways of using FireShot, such as:

- Saving screenshots to disk
- Uploading to web
- Copying to clipboard
- E-mailing
- Exporting to external editor
- Printing
- Getting a BASE64 encoded string of the captured page

The embedding is quick and simple.
